<h2>What it does:</h2>
It basically gives a probability of whether the person is non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, or diabetic. Hence he/she can take necessary actions relevant to it.

<h2>How we built it:</h2>
First of all, we built a machine learning model which gave the predictions using deep learning. In that model, we consider a total number of 21 parameters that are medically standard and relevant for our predictions. After that, we created webpages using React.js by which we got the inputs from the user. Consequently, we use Flask Framework for supporting the backend. In the Flask Framework, we used the .h5 file to provide access to the user input to our ml model so that it can predict the result and output be displayed accordingly. Eventually, we deployed our web app on Heroku.

<h2>What we learned:</h2>
Through this very project, we got a chance to know about the Diabetes epidemic and its depth. Also by making the website for this project we polished our skills in web development. Also, we gained the knowledge of making a good predictions using machine learning models. Besides, we learned about brand-new technologies and were glad to use them.
